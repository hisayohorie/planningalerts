  How to contribute councillor information
%p
  Thank you so much for your interest in contributinng councillor information!
  Your work makes it possible for millions of Australians to write to their local councils.
  Here is how to do it.

%h3
  Find your council website
%p
  = link_to "Find your council from here", council_directory_path
%p
  If you could not find the council you are looking for in the directory, try
  = link_to "google", 'google.com'
%p
  To be sure, enter the province name where the council exists
  (ex. "Cessnock City Council, New South Wales”, "George Town Council, Tasmania”)

%h3
  Find councillor information
%p
  Typically, there is a navigation menu that says something like
  %ul
    %li
      About Council
    %li
      Council
    %li
      Your Council
    %li
      Our Council
    %li
      About us
  %p
    You may have to click the tab, or sometimes you have to put your cursor on the tab and the sub-menu shows up.
  = image_tag "/tutorial/lockyervalley_menu.png", size: "900x350"
  %br
  = image_tag "/tutorial/derebin_menu.png", size: "900x350"
  %br
  = image_tag "/tutorial/portAugusta_menu.png", size: "900x350"
  %br
  %br
  %p
    And under the page, typically there are categories like
    %ul
      %li
        Councillor’s profile
      %li
        Councillors
      %li
        Mayor and Councillors
      %li
        Councillors and Wards
      %li
        Elected Councillors
    %br
    = image_tag "/tutorial/lockyervally_mayorAndCouncil.png", size: "900x400"
    %br
    = image_tag "/tutorial/WardsAndCouncillors.png", size: "900x400"
    %br
    = image_tag "/tutorial/OurOrganization.png", size: "900x400"

    %p
      Different councils have different navigation to the councillors information.
      Here are some examples of the path
    %br
    %h4

    %p
      Home > Council > Our Organization > Councillors
    = image_tag "/tutorial/Councillors_2.png", size: "900x400"
    %br
    %h4
      City of Fremantle, West Australia
    %p
      Home > Council > Your Council > Your Elected Members
    = image_tag "/tutorial/YourElectedMembers.png", size: "900x400"
    %br
    %h4
      Alpine Shire Council, Victoria
    %p
      Home > Council > About Council > Councillors
    = image_tag "/tutorial/Councillors3.png", size: "900x400"
    %br
    %br
    %p
      Then finally, you will see a list of councillor information!
    %h3
      Finding the councillor information
    %p
      What we want is:
      %ul
        %li
          Name of the councillor
        %li
          Email address of the councillor
    = image_tag "/tutorial/councillorInfo.png", size: "900x400"

    %h3
      Inputting the councillor information
    %p
      Make sure there is ONE space between the first name and the last name
    = image_tag "/tutorial/contributionInput.png", size: "700x400"

    %p
      Then input the email of the councillor. If you choose to copy and paste the address,
      your mailor may open up if the councillor's email address is a link. To avoid opening up your
      mailor and copy the email address, use command + click to open the menu and
      choose "Copy Email Address".
    = image_tag "/tutorial/councillorEmail.png", size: "700x400"

    %br
    %p
      If you have more than 2 councillor information to submit, hit "Submit Another Councillor" and repeat the process. Once you finish inputting
      the information, click "Submit (number) of councillor information" button
    %h3

    %p
      You will be redirected to the page that asks your contact information.
      This is for us to keep you updated when your contribution goes live, and also to send you a little thank you message and
      %strong this information is optional.
